# FriendsFinder

This application guides the user through a friend survey in hopes to match it with a friend that has the most things in common with him/her.

This happens by submitting the answers to the questions with a value from 1-5 of strongly agree to strongly disagree, and then running the answers through a filter where the answers between friends that match the most gives out the best potential friend match.
